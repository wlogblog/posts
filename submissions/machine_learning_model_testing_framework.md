Three key tests for machine learning projects are outlined below. These tests are designed to test the code functionality and not the accuracy of the model. 

## 1. Unit tests
The purpose of unit testing is to test the input and output of the functions of the model. 

## 2. Integration tests

## 3. Post deployment tests
